## OBJ Loader 2
An update to the default [OBJ model import library](https://code.google.com/archive/p/saitoobjloader/) for Processing. Intended to improve performance for large models by avoiding creating an individual PShape for each face, see http://www.cutsquash.com/2015/04/better-obj-model-loading-in-processing/ and https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2873#issuecomment-61536733.

Still in development
